- **Consumer**: Can log in to check their bill and pay it online (via a secure checkout page).

## How to run it
1. Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node lab1.js
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3002`

That's it! Feel free to look around.
